ABSTRACT 

The HRTPO has released the Average Weekday Traffic Volumes for 
Major Roadways in Hampton Roads report on an annual basis since 2006. This document continues that effort by detailing regional traffic volumes for the years 2007-2012. In addition, this report now includes for the first time speed data collected by INRIX. It also includes congestion levels based on the above volumes and speeds. 

This report is produced as part of the region's Congestion Management 
Process (CMP). The Congestion Management Process is an on-going 
process that identifies, develops, evaluates, and implements transportation strategies to enhance mobility regionwide.
