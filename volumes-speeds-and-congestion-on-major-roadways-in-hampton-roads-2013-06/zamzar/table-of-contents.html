INTRODUCTION 
                      
The HRTPO has released the Average Weekday Traffic Volumes for 
Major Roadways in Hampton Roads report on an annual basis since 2006. This document continues that effort by detailing regional traffic volumes for the years 2007-2012. 

The traffic volume data included in this document is collected from a variety of 
sources, including the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), the regional bridge and tunnel facilities, and tolled facilities. Data is also included from those localities in Hampton Roads that maintain their own traffic count programs, including Hampton, Newport News, and Virginia Beach. 

In addition to traffic volume data, this report includes speed data collected by 
INRIX for the first time. INRIX collects this data using millions of probe vehicles, including taxis, delivery vans, fleet vehicles, trucks, and smartphone users. The speed data included in this report represents hourly weekday data averaged over the entire year 2012 broken down by direction. Peak hour congestion data and maps are also included in this report, based on the speed and traffic volume data. 

This report is produced as part of the region's Congestion Management Process 
(CMP). The Congestion Management Process is an on-going process that identifies, develops, evaluates, and implements transportation strategies to enhance mobility regionwide. As such, this document includes those roadways that comprise the Hampton Roads Congestion Management Process network. This network includes all roadways classified by VDOT as minor arterials, principal arterials, expressways, freeways, or interstates, as well as selected collectors. More information about the Hampton Roads Congestion Management Process is available on the Hampton Roads Transportation Planning 
Organization's website at http://www.hrtpo.org/page/congestion-management.
